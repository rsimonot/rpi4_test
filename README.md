# rpi4_test
First hands on a RPI4

<ins>What I've done so far</ins>

-> I wanted to write some code on my laptop, test it with my webcam to simulate the raspberry pi + camera setup
-> opencv4nodejs won't install properly on Mac, I'll come back to it later and win the fight
-> for now, I'll as soon as possible pull that code on the RPI and test/correct it

_.+\* I'll try to update this when I move on \*+._
